# SCALER_Stoichiometry
SCALER (Scale, Consumers, and Lotic Ecosystem Rates) project basal resource stoichiometry data.  
Basal resources were coarse (CBOM) and fine (FBOM) benthic organic matter from four stream networks in distinct biomes.
Data is used in Farrell et al. 2018 *Ecosystems* manuscript (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-018-0247-z)
